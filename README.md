Custom WordPress plugin developed for non-profit organization, Project Princess. This plugin adds functionality for user accounts and tracking service hours.

### Notes

This code could definitely be more organized with better comments, directory structure, and separation of logic, but due to time constraints, I had to complete this project within the span of a few days. I had never used PHP or developed for Wordpress before, either. The final product ended up exceeding the expectations of the organization leaders and met their service-hour tracking needs.
